# NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::DetachIfNotModified - Short-circuit requests with If-Modified-Since headers

# VERSION

version v0.1.1

# SYNOPSIS

In your Catalyst class:

```perl
use Catalyst qw/
    DetachIfNotModified
  /;
```

In a controller method:

```perl
my $item = ...

$c->detach_if_not_modified_since( $item->timestamp );

# Do some CPU-intensive stuff or generate response body here.
```

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin will allow your [Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) app to handle requests with
`If-Modified-Since` headers.

If the content of a web page has not been modified since a given date,
you can quickly bail out and avoid generating a web page that you do
not need to.

This can improve the performance of your website.

This should be used with [Plack::Middleware::ConditionalGET](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::ConditionalGET).

# METHODS

## detach\_if\_not\_modified\_since

```
$c->detach_if_not_modified_since( $timestamp );
```

This sets the `Last-Modified` header in the response to the
`$timestamp`, and checks if the request contains a
`If-Modified-Since` header that not less than the timestamp.  If it
does, then it will set the response status code to `304` (Not
Modified) and detach.

The `$timestamp` may be a unix epoch, or an object with an `epoch`
method, such as a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object.

This should only be used with GET or HEAD requests.

If you later need to reset the `Last-Modified` header after calling
this method, you can use

```
$c->res->headers->remove_header('Last-Modified');
```

# CAVEATS

Be careful when aggregating a collection of objects into a single
timestamp, e.g. the maximum timestamp from a list.  If a member is
removed from that collection, then the maximum timestamp won't be
affected, and the result is that an outdated web page may be cached by
user agents.
